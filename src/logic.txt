2 add 2 bot:
	currentNode;
	dribblerState;

In each frame:
	getPicture();
	
	For Each bot:
		IDLE:	
			currDest -> nearest ball
			state->MOVETOBALL
	
		MOVE2BALL:
			if size(lines) = 0, callRRT
			else check next node
					if obstructed run RRT
		        	if close to the ball
                        dribblerState -> on
					if last node && reached ball, state->CAPTURED
                
        CAPTURED:
            if captured ball, state->MOVE2GOAL
			currDest->goal
			
		MOVE2GOAL:
			if size(lines) = 0, callRRT
			speed -> slowspeed
			else check next node
				if obstructed run RRT
				if penultimate node, state->SHOOT

        SHOOT:
		    speed -> max_speed
            if close to goal
                reverse dribbler
                state -> IDLE
			
		
        call moveToPoint
			


Still to write:
        

moveToPoint 
    
    check if 
        on a node
            updates the currentNodeIndex
            calculate angleDest
            control(angle)

        between 2 nodes
            calculate distanceToGo
            control(distance, state, dribblerState)
            

            
control(bool isTurn, float error)
    if turn,
        run turn control
    if not turn,
        run straight pwm depending on state + dribblerState

    sendMotroCommands()
        
    

sendMotorCOmmands
        sends the pwm values for each motor
